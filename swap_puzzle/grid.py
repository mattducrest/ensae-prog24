    A class representing the grid from the swap puzzle. It supports rectangular grids. 

    Attributes:

    n: int
        Number of columns in the grid

        The state of the grid, a list of list such that state[i][j] is the number in the cell (i, j), i.e., in the i-th line and j-th column. 
        Note: lines are numbered 0..m and columns are numbered 0..n.
